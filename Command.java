/**
 * This class is part of the "Dreamscape" application. 
 * "Dreamscape" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command currently consists of a list of strings: a command word and various other
 * words (for example, if the command was "take map", then there are two strings: "take" and "map"
 * if the command is "give bread frogbert" there are three strings: "give", "bread", "frogbert").
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is <null>.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.
